# Movies-ETL

## Overview

The main purpose of this analysis was to create an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) using Movie data from wikipedia and kaggle. The ETL process was used to clean the datatsets, create better formating, performing joins, then loading into a SQL database. All work can be seen in jupyter notebook files. All data files have been saved under resources.
